# Bloodborne Caryll Runes

I copy the main steps of the PSD of [Start orb Mark of the hunter (Bloodborne) for Windows](https://vsthemes.org/en/icon/startorb/857-mark-of-the-hunter-bloodborne.html) that by [Elementary](https://vsthemes.org/en/user/Elementary/), the [cover](https://www.deviantart.com/bebelsh/art/Mark-of-the-hunter-732406069) by [bebelsh](https://www.deviantart.com/bebelsh).

Then I completed the other basic runes based on [Bloodborne Caryll Rune Vectors](https://www.deviantart.com/lolly535/art/Bloodborne-Caryll-Rune-Vectors-545838128) that by [lolly535](https://www.deviantart.com/lolly535).
